Design a high-conversion, professional landing page for this project. The goal is to immediately establish trust, communicate innovation, and drive sign-ups via the main Call-to-Action (CTA)."

Visual Style & Aesthetic (The Zanzibar DNA):

"The design must strictly follow a Modern, High-Contrast Dark Mode Aesthetic.

Background: Deep, near-black or very dark charcoal gray (avoiding pure #000000 for better contrast).

Color Palette: Primary color should be the current theme used in globals.css used for accents, highlights, and interactive elements. Secondary colors should be subtle grays for supporting text.

Typography: Use Massive, Bold, Geometric/Sans-serif typography for main headings to create a strong visual impact. Body text must be highly legible white or light gray.

Visual Effects: Incorporate subtle, high-tech visual effects like soft glows/neon accents around key text or elements, and polished, glassmorphism or metallic textures on cards/buttons."

Layout & Structure (The Key Feature):

"The layout must be Dynamic Split-Screen or Centrally Divided.

Hero Section: Implement a vertically split hero section. The left side features the main headline and CTA. The right side features a large, dynamic visual/3D model/animation representing our product or concept.

Scroll Behavior: As the user scrolls, the split-screen sections should react with smooth, interactive transitions—ideally, the left and right panes move at different speeds (subtle parallax) or one side locks while the other scrolls (sticky scrolling)."

Content Placement & Key Elements:

"The page structure must include the following sections, arranged vertically after the hero, maintaining the dark theme and bold typography:"

Hero Section:

Headline (H1)

Subtext: A brief, 2-line description.

Primary CTA: [Insert CTA text, e.g., "Start Free Trial" or "Request Early Access"].

Visual: A complex, abstract, or product-in-action visualization using the accent color.

Feature Overview Section:

Use a minimalist card layout (3 cards) with subtle inner shadows/borders.

Each card must clearly state a key benefit: [Feature 1 Name], [Feature 2 Name], [Feature 3 Name].

Social Proof/Trust Section:

Display logos of [List 3-5 recognizable or aspirational client/partner names] in a muted monochrome style.

Detailed Section (Optional):

A section demonstrating a before/after comparison or a data visualization using the split-screen concept again, if possible.

Final CTA/Footer:

A final, centered, and unmissable CTA block that repeats the primary call-to-action.
